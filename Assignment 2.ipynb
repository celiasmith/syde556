This equation can be simulated numerically by taking  small time steps (Euler's method).  When the voltage reaches the threshold $1$, the neuron will spike and then reset its voltage to $0$ for the next $\\tau_{ref}$ amount of time.  Also, if the voltage goes below zero at any time, reset it back to zero.  For this question, $\\tau_{RC}$=0.02 and $\\tau_{ref}$=0.002\n",
