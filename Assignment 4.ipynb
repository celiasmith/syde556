Connect the first ensemble to the second such that it computes the identity function, using a post-synaptic time constant of 0.01.  Create an input that is a value of 1 for 0.1<t<0.4 seconds, and otherwise is zero (you can use a lambda function).\n",

    "Build a neural integrator.  This consists of one ensemble, one input, a connection from the input to the ensemble, and a connection from the ensemble back to itself.  The ensemble should have 200 neurons and the same parameters as in question 1.  The post-synaptic time constant of the recurrent connection is 0.05, and the post-synaptic time constant of the input is 0.005.  \n",

    "To be an integrator, the desired dynamical system is ${{dx} \\over {dt}} = u$.  To implement this with the NEF, we use the transformation discussed in class, so the feedback connection should compute $f'(x)=x$ and the input connection should compute $g'(x)=\\tau u$, where $u$ is the input and $\\tau$ is the post-synaptic time constant of the *feedback* connection.  So the feedback connection should compute the identity function and the input connection should compute 0.05 times the input.\n",

What is the expected ideal result (i.e. if we just mathematically computed the integral of the input, what would we get?)  How does the simulated output compare to that ideal?</li>\n",
    "<li>[1 mark] Change the neural simulation to rate mode (use `model.config[nengo.Ensemble].neuron_type = nengo.LIFRate()` which will change all neurons in the simulation to LIF rate neurons).  Re-run the simulation in rate mode.  Show the resulting plots.  How does this compare to the result in part (a)?</li>\n",
    "<li>[1 mark] Returning to spiking mode, change the input to be a value of 0.9 from t=0.04 to 0.16.  Show the same plots as before (the input and the value represented by the ensemble over 1.5 seconds).  How does this compare to (a)?  Why is it better or worse?</li>\n",
    "<li>[1 mark] Change the input to a ramp input from 0 to 0.9 from t=0 to t=0.45 (and 0 for t>0.45). Show the same plots as in the previous parts of this question.  What does the ensemble end up representing, and why?  What is the (ideal) equation for the curve traced out by the ensemble?</li>\n",
    "<li>[1 mark] Change the input to `5*sin(5*t)`.  What should the value represented by the ensemble be (write the equation)?  How well does it do?  What are the differences between the model's behaviour and the expected ideal behaviour?</li>\n",
