    "## 1) Decoding from a population\n",

    "As you did in previous assignments, make a population of 20 LIF neurons representing a 1-dimensional value, and compute a decoder for them.  For parameters, $\\tau_{ref}$=0.002s, $\\tau_{RC}$=0.02s, the maximum firing rates are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 100 and 200Hz (at the max radius), and the x-intercepts are chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between -2 and 2.  Remember that the $\\alpha$ and $J^{bias}$ terms are computed based on these x-intercepts and maximum firing rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally easiest to compute decoders using the original method from Assignment 1, where we use the rate-mode approximation for the neurons to generate the $A$ matrix, then find $\\Gamma=A^T A + \\sigma^2 I$.  You can use this approach to find decoders, and these decoders should work even when you simulate the neurons in terms of spikes (in question 2 on).  The only difference will be that they will need to be scaled by ``dt``, your simulation time step.\n",

Using that neuron's $\\alpha$ and $J^{bias}$ value, construct two neurons: both with the same $\\alpha$ and $J^{bias}$, but one with $e$=+1 and the other with $e$=-1.  With the function from the last assignment, generate a random input $x(t)$ that is 1 second long, with rms=1, dt=0.001, and an upper limit of 5Hz.  Feed that signal into the two neurons and generate spikes.  Decode the spikes back into $\\hat{x}(t)$ using a post-synaptic current filter $h(t)$ with a time constant of $\\tau$=0.005.\n",
