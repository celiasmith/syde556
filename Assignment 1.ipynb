Choose the maximum firing rates randomly (uniformly distributed between 100Hz and 200Hz), and choose the x-intercepts randomly (uniformly distributed between -0.95 and 0.95).  Use those values to compute the corresponding $\\alpha$ and $J^{bias}$ values for each neuron.  The encoders $e$ are randomly chosen and are either +1 or -1 for each neuron.

Of course, if the graph in 1.1a was extended to $x>1$ (or $x<-1$), neurons would start firing faster than their maximum firing rate.  Similarly, here the \"maximum firing rate\" means the firing rate when $x=e$.
